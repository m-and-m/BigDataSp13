BigDataSp13
===========
I took a Big Data class at SJSU in Spring 2013.

The course had a practical focus on the techniques and tools 
for capturing, storing, processing and analyzing batch mode basis big data.
This is a hands-on course in which students are expected to work in teams 
to complete at least 2 real world projects.

The tools used are...
- Cloudera (http://www.cloudera.com/)
- Splunk (http://www.splunk.com/) 
- GoGrid (http://www.gogrid.com/)

The 2 projects:
- Foursquare using Cloudera on GoGrid (Foursquare.tar.gz)
- Natural Disaster using Splunk on GoGrid (NaturalDisaster.tar.gz)

Each archive contains 1 report document & 1 presentation PowerPoint of 
all above project is here.
